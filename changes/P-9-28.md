# Security Changes in Android P (Preview)

## Announcement blog post

Quoting [Previewing Android P](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/previewing-android-p.html)

> Open Mobile API for NFC payments and secure transactions
> Android P adds an implementation of the GlobalPlatform Open Mobile API to Android. On supported devices, apps can use the OMAPI API to access secure elements (SE) to enable smart-card payments and other secure services. A hardware abstraction layer (HAL) provides the underlying API for enumerating a variety of Secure Elements (eSE, UICC, and others) available.

> In Android P we're moving to a more consistent UI for fingerprint authentication across apps and devices. Android now provides a standard system dialog to prompt the user to touch the fingerprint sensor, managing text and placement as appropriate for the device. Apps can trigger the system fingerprint dialog using a new FingerprintDialog API. We recommend switching to the new system dialog as soon as possible.

> As part of a larger effort to move all network traffic away from cleartext (unencrypted HTTP) to TLS, we're also changing the defaults for Network Security Configuration to block all cleartext traffic. If you are using a Network Security Configuration, you'll now need to make connections over TLS, unless you explicitly opt-in to cleartext for specific domains.

  - "High-assurance user confirmation" is interesting. Keen to know if the TEE UI protection is overselling a software backed UI control, as I doubt all P devices will need to support hardware TEE UI control

    - Can only decrypt with a key when the keyguard is unlocked
  - Biometric Prompt
    - Will auto uses Iris / finger / face etc depending on user prefs
  - TLS enforced as default
  - Boring SSL now has FIPS approved algorithms (by NIST)
  - Key Attestation [changes](https://github.com/doridori/Android-Security-Reference/blob/master/framework/key_attestation.md)
  - Cannot access camera / mic / sensors when app in background
    - Now needs foreground service
