The [Play Integrity Api](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity) was added in 2021. Seems to be an encapulation of SafetyNet and Google Play Licensing APIs. The Play Store/Service API manages the checking of the expected signing key for you as opposed to manually doing this in your own backend as you would likely do with SafetyNet.
